        <h2>What is It?</h2>
        <p>
            Impeachment is the process by which any Civil Federal Officer, such as the President, Vice president, or a judge, is removed from office following misconduct. It is used to remove individuals who have abused their power or have engaged in behavior incompatible with the requirements of their role. It can be used for cases of treason, bribery, or other “high crimes and misdemeanors”.

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <p>
            There are two steps to the impeachment and removal process. First, Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 of the constitution grants the House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment. Therefore an allegation of wrongdoing is investigated by the House of Representatives, and the Articles of Impeachment are introduced by either a member of the House of Representatives, or certain non-members (such as special prosecutors). A formal impeachment can be thought of like an indictment for a crime, it is not yet a conviction and does not indicate guilt. If an impeachment vote is successful with a simple majority, then the matter is turned over to the Senate. The Senate is given sole power to try impeachments by Article I, Section 3, Clauses 6 and 7. They can further investigate the reason for the impeachment, by calling witnesses, or examining documents, and will subsequently hold a trial (with the senators acting as the jury). This process begins at 1PM on the day after formal impeachment proceedings are delivered to the Senate by the House. The case for conviction is made by several members of the House of Representatives, known as “managers”. They act as prosecutors in the Senate trial, while the accused is permitted to defend themselves in turn. Both sides are permitted to cross-examine opposing witnesses. Since this is not a criminal trial, it is generally accepted that the burden of proof is less than the “beyond a reasonable doubt” traditionally seen in criminal prosecutions. Finally, if a ⅔ majority of the senate votes to convict, the resolution passes.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            Once the Senate has formally convicted, the subject will immediately be removed from their office. The Senate can also decide to bar the subject from holding any new federal offices. That vote requires only a simple majority to pass. It is important to note that these are the only punishments that can be enforced through the Impeachment process. No fines or jail time can be administered, for example. Additionally, benefits such as pensions or even lifetime secret service protection (for presidents) are not affected after a conviction. However, if the activity that led to the impeachment is a crime, the federal official can be prosecuted under normal federal criminal law.

        <h2>History of Use</h2>
        <p>
            Impeachment as a concept originated in English Common Law, and was adopted by the framers of the constitution as part of our system of checks and balances. In total, 21 individuals have been successfully impeached by the House of Representatives. Most notably, presidents Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump have all been formally impeached, with former President Trump being the first American in history to be impeached twice. However, none of them were ever convicted by the Senate. Only 8 federal officers have been convicted and removed from office by this procedure, all of them Federal Judges. Impeachments have been brought before the House for quite a few reasons, including bribery, abuse of power, “drunkenness”, perjury, and corruption.
